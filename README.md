 [#ArtCollections...](https://artdepot.herokuapp.com/) 


## Project Description
ArtCollections...is a simple app built for no reason whatsoever other than fullfilling MVP requirements for GA Project 2.


## Technologies
The main goal here is just to showcase use of NodeJS for server creation, Express as framework on top of it. MangoDB for data storage. Mongoose API for intersacting with database.

## Features
The CRUD set of operations is used to get servers to execute POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests respectively):

Create (POST) - Make something
Read (GET)- Get something
Update (PUT) - Change something
Delete (DELETE)- Remove something
POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests let us construct Rest APIs.

## Additional Notes
The app if fairly stupid...so I really take no pride in it besides the fact that this is my first full stack project and it has all the required functionality
