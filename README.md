ArtCollections...is a simple app built to showcase MVP requirements for GAs Project 2.


## Technologies

- NodeJS for server creation
- Express as framework
- MangoDB for data storage
- Mongoose API for intersacting with database.

## Approach/Features

The CRUD set of operations is used to get servers to execute 
- POST 
- GET 
- PUT
- DELETE 
requests respectively

Create (POST) - Make something
Read (GET)- Get something
Update (PUT) - Change something
Delete (DELETE)- Remove something

POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests let us construct Rest APIs.

 - Authentication 
  
## Unsolved Problems/ToDo's

1. Front end features are required such as nav  and footer need to be added
