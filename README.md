ArtDepot is a simple app built using Express framework on top of Node.js used for server creation  with JavaScript as a server-side language.

The data used in the app is stored in 
MongoDB database. 

The CRUD set of operations is used to get servers to execute POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests respectively:

Create (POST) - Make something
Read (GET)- Get something
Update (PUT) - Change something
Delete (DELETE)- Remove something
POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests let us construct Rest APIs.
